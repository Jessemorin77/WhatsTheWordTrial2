what we need to do is to:
  Redesign the home page

  the home page needs 1 of either 2 inputs, we can do this, the end goal is that the user needs to see events in their area, or they need to find an event. 
  1.) events in area
    -get location
    -set location

    State: check for location and render events
    or 
    render suggested events

  2.) Search events
    how events can be sorted are by location, title, eventType, status, school

  Events:
    Route Called
    GetLocation
    true: query events in location
    false: query events

    Search by: Location, name, title, eventType, status, school

Structure:
  Component:
    Search Form:
      Data: location

      client:Form -> action
      server:
        action:
          Data: inputs
          Return: actions

  Component: 
    ListEvent
